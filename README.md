# RESUMÃ‰ WEBSITE
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Hello everyone, this is my final project from Harvard CS50.
In this project I tried to build a website that shows all my work experiences and courses that I did.
Also, I talk a little bit about what is my dream and where I want to come.

In the website, you can see elements that moves with mouse touch, also a background video and a form to send me a message. 
Moreover you can see my contact pages as linkedin and github.


I'm really happy to be finish cs50, I think I've been learning a lot with this course in the past several months.
